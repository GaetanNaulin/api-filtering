# Api Filtering

Api Filtering is a laravel package allowing you to filter resources (based on eloquent models) through http parameters.

This package regroups the [Server Side](https://github.com/Ifnot/api-filtering/wiki/Server-side) filtering mechanism and a simple [Client Side (PHP)](https://github.com/Ifnot/api-filtering/wiki/Client-side-(PHP)) builder for building http query parameters (it can helps you testing, even query other apis !).

## Specifications

Actually there is one specification :

* AFS1 (Api Filtering Specification 1) : Define the supported http parameters for filtering resources.

## Installation

Require the package using composer :

    composer require ifnot/api-filtering

Refer to [Server Side](https://github.com/Ifnot/api-filtering/wiki/Server-side) or [Client Side (PHP)](https://github.com/Ifnot/api-filtering/wiki/Client-side-(PHP)) for usage.
